# odin_recipes

This project will cover the skills I have learned using HTML.
I will be making a website that has a few links to other webpages that will include recipes.
These pages will consist of lists and images aswell as demostrating how to use paragraphs and headings to organize the pages.
I will also focus on making clear and consise git commit messages.
